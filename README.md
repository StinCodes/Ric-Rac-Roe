Steps:
1. Build a Tic Tac Toe game with Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS
2. Refactor that game to use an MVC pattern and explore why this pattern is helpful
3. Refactor the game to TypeScript, learning how to setup TypeScript from scratch and why it is useful
4. Refactor the game to React + TypeScript, explaining how to setup React from scratch and exploring why React is useful and what problems it solves over a Vanilla approach
